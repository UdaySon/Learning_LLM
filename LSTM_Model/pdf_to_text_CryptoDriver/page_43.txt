Note:
CRYPTO_E_KEY_NOT_AVAILABLE is meant to indicate that required key elements of
a key in the context of a specific Crypto Primitive or key management function
have been programmed before but at least one of these key elements cannot be
accessed at the moment (for instance it is temporarily not accessible, e.g. when
the key is disabled due to debugger connection).
CRYPTO_E_KEY_EMPTY is meant to indicate that the referred key content has not
been written so far and has no default value (For example, in SHE 1.1, the error
code ERC_KEY_EMPTY would be returned then, "if the application attempts to
use a key that has not been initialized".)
