If no errors are detected by the Crypto Driver, the Crypto Driver processes the crypto
service, configured in job, with the underlying hardware or software solutions.
[SWS_Crypto_00134] ⌈ If the crypto primitive requires input data, its memory
location is referred by the pointer job->jobPrimitiveInput.inputPtr.
On calling Crypto_ProcessJob, the length of this data is stored in job-
>jobPrimitiveInput.inputLength.
This applies analogously to job->jobPrimitiveInput.secondaryInputPtr
and job->jobPrimitiveInput.secondaryInputLength respectively job-
>jobPrimitiveInput.tertiaryinputPtr and
job->jobPrimitiveInput.tertiaryInputLength, if they shall be used for the
chosen crypto primitive.
If the input is redirected to a key element, the input buffer of the respective key
element has to be used.

[SWS_Crypto_00203] ⌈ If job->jobRedirectionInfoRef is not a NULLPTR and
the configuration bit for the inputRedirection, secondaryInputRedirection and/or
tertiaryInputRedirection is set within job-> jobRedirectionInfoRef-
>redirectionConfig, then the corresponding key element buffer located by job-
> jobRedirectionInfoRef->inputKeyId+ job->
jobRedirectionInfoRef->inputKeyElementId, job->
jobRedirectionInfoRef->secondaryInputKeyId+ job->
jobRedirectionInfoRef->secondaryInputKeyElementId, and/or
jobRedirectionInfoRef->tertiaryInputKeyId+ job->
jobRedirectionInfoRef->tertiaryInputKeyElementId and its length shall
be used.
Any data provided by the input parameter of the function interface shall be ignored.

[SWS_Crypto_00135] ⌈ If the crypto primitive requires a buffer for the result, its
memory location is referred by the pointer job-
>jobPrimitiveInput.outputPtr. On calling this function, job-
>jobPrimitiveInput. outputLengthPtr shall contain the size of the
associated buffer. When the request has finished, the actual length of the returned
value shall be stored.
This applies analogously to job->jobPrimitiveInput.secondaryOutputPtr
and job->jobPrimitiveInput.secondaryOutputLengthPtr, if they shall be
used for the chosen crypto primitive.
If the output is redirected to a key element, the output buffer of the respective key
element has to be used instead.
