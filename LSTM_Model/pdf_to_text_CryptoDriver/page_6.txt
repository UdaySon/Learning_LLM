1 Introduction and functional overview
This specification specifies the functionality, API and the configuration of the
AUTOSAR Basic Software module Crypto Driver.
The Crypto Drivers are located in the Microcontroller Abstraction Layer, which is
below the Crypto Hardware Abstraction Layer (Crypto Interface [4]) and the upper
service layer (Crypto Service Manager [5]). The Crypto Driver is a driver for a specific
device, that is only abstracting the features supported by the hardware.
The Crypto Drivers allow defining of different Crypto Driver Objects (i.e. AES
accelerator, SW component, etc), which shall be used for concurrent requests in
different buffers. For each hardware object a priority-dependent job processing shall
be supported. A crypto software solution (i.e. software-based CDD) can define
interfaces identical to the Crypto Drivers for interacting with the upper layers, which
shall provide an interface to the applications.
