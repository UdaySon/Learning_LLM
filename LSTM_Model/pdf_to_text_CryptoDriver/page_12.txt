5 Dependencies to other modules
[SWS_Crypto_00003] If an off-chip crypto hardware module (e.g. external HSM) is
used, the Crypto Driver shall use services of other MCAL drivers (e.g. SPI).
Hint: If the Crypto Driver uses services of other MCAL drivers (e.g. SPI), it must be
ensured that these drivers are up and running before initializing the Crypto Driver
module.
[SWS_Crypto_00116] ⌈The Crypto Driver shall be able to store key material in a
non-volatile way if supported by the dedicated crypto hardware.

Note:
The Crypto Drivers are called by the Crypto Interface (CRYIF), which is implemented
according to the cryptographic interface specification [4].
The Crypto Drivers access the underlying hardware and software objects, to
calculate results with their cryptographic primitives. The results shall be forwarded to
the CRYIF.
5.1 File structure
5.1.1 Code File Structure
The code file structure is not defined within this specification completely.
[SWS_Crypto_00005] ⌈ The code file structure shall contain a source file Crypto.c
and a code file Crypto_KeyManagement.c.
