7.2.4 Key Management
A key consists of one or more key elements.
Examples of key elements are the key material itself, an initialization vector, a seed
state for random number generation, or the proof of the SHE standard.
Each key element has a defined access right for read or write access. The access
right itself is defined by enumerations with an assigned value (see
[ECUC_Crypto_00024] or [ECUC_Crypto_00027]) in the configuration of a
CryptoKeyElement. The integer values of these enumerations are chosen in a way,
that the assignment of an access right to a key element also deduces further right
accesses. The lower the value, the higher the access right. This allows an easy
compare of the assigned value to a required right access by numbers.
Example:
If a key element has access rights of CRYPTO_RA_INTERNAL_COPY=2, the right
permission also applies to CRYPTO_RA_ENCRYPTED=1 and
CRYPTO_RA_ALLOWED=0, because both rights of the assigned enumeration
values are lower and therefore are lower in the ranking of the access rights.
[SWS_Crypto_00219] ⌈ Access rights shall be taken into account when direct
access to key elements are required. This applies for read and write access.
 ()
Keys or key elements can be copied using the key copy interface functions. This
allows, for example, to store keys in one driver channel that provides secure key
storage and to distribute them to other driver implementations that have no such
capabilities. However, it is important that access rights to key elements are guarded
within the copy operation to avoid unintended disclosure of stored keys.
[SWS_Crypto_00220] ⌈ A source key element must have higher or the same rights
than the destination key element when key elements are copied using the key
copying interfaces. A source key must have at least the rights
CRYPTO_RA_INTERNAL_COPY or lower to get copied.
 ()
Info:
An internal copy operation can only be performed if the key elements are located in
the same crypto driver object.
[SWS_Crypto_00221] ⌈ Jobs shall use the assigned key elements without guarding
the key access rights with the following exceptions:
 If a key element is used for input using the input re-direction, the key
element must have access rights CRYPTO_RA_INTERNAL_COPY or lower.
If input re-direction is used for CryptoPrimitiveService ENCRYPT/DECRYPT
or AEAD_ENCRYPT/AEAD_DECRYPT, the access rights must be set to
RA_ENCRYPTED or lower.1)
