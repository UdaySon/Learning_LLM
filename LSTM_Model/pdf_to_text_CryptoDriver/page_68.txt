Parameters cryptoKey Holds the identifier of the key whose available element ids shall be
(in) Id exported.
Holds a pointer to the memory location in which the number of key
keyElement elements in the given key is stored. On calling this function, this
Parameters
IdsLength parameter shall contain the size of the buffer provided by keyElement

Ptr IdsPtr. When the request has finished, the actual number of key
elements shall be stored.
Parameters keyElement Contains the pointer to the array where the ids of the key elements
(out) IdsPtr shall be stored.
E_OK: Request successful

CRYPTO_E_BUSY: Request failed, Crypto Driver Object is busy
Description Used to retrieve information which key elements are available in a given key.
Available via Crypto.h

[SWS_Crypto_00161] ⌈ If the Crypto Driver is not yet initialized and if development
error detection for the Crypto Driver is enabled, the function
Crypto_KeyElementIdsGet shall report CRYPTO_E_UNINIT to the DET and
return E_NOT_OK.
()
[SWS_Crypto_00162] ⌈ If cryptoKeyId is out of range and if development error
detection for the Crypto Driver is enabled, the function
Crypto_KeyElementIdsGet shall report CRYPTO_E_PARAM_HANDLE to the DET
and return E_NOT_OK.
()
If no errors are detected by the Crypto Driver, the function stores all ids of the key
elements available in the key identified by cryptoKeyId to an array provided by
keyElementIdsPtr. It also stores the number of elements to the value, which is
pointed by keyElementIdsLengthPtr.
Note:
This function is needed by the CRYIF when a whole key should be copied from one
Crypto Driver to another Crypto Driver by the CRYIF.
