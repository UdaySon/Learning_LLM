The init value is the value, which is stored into the key element at the initialization of
the crypto driver when the key element is empty. It is e.g. used for the key element
with the id CRYPTO_KE_<Service>_ALGORITHM. This way, the key management
functions can be configured. To provide e.g. different key exchange algorithms in one
Crypto Driver, the vendor can pre-configure the following containers and set the init
values of the CRYPTO_KE_<Service>_ALGORITHM key element to a vendor
specific value:
CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_Algorithm_RSA
- ID = 11
- Init value = 0x00
- Size = 1
- Read Access = RA_NONE
- Write Access = WA_NONE
CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_Algorithm_Ed25519
- ID = 11
- Init value = 0x01
- Size = 1
- Read Access = RA_NONE
- Write Access = WA_NONE

- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_Algorithm_RSA
- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_PartnerPubKey
- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_OwnPubKey
- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_Base
- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_PrivKey
- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_SharedValue
CryptoKeyType_KeyExchange_Ed25519
- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_Algorithm_Ed25519
- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_PartnerPubKey
- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_OwnPubKey
- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_Base
- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_PrivKey
- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_SharedValue
When a key exchange should be performed with a CryptoKey of type
CryptoKeyType_KeyExchange_Ed25519, the Crypto Driver knows with the value
stored in the key element CRYPTO_KE_KEYEXCHANGE_ALGORITHM that
Ed25519 shall be used as underlying cryptographic primitive.
If a key should be used in more than one primitive e.g. KeyExchange and AES-
Encrypt-CBC, the CryptoKeyType could be extended by needed elements:
CryptoKeyType_KeyExchange_Cipher_combined
- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_Algorithm_Ed25519
- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_PartnerPubKey
- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_OwnPubKey
- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_Base
- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_PrivKey
- CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_SharedValue
o ID = 1
- CryptoKeyElement_Cipher_IV
Note that CryptoKeyElement_KeyExchange_SharedValue has the id set to 1. When
