CryptoKeyType_KeyExchange_Cipher_combined, the shared value of the key
exchange is automatically used as encryption key.
7.2 General Behavior
The Crypto Driver can have one or more Crypto Driver Objects.
[SWS_Crypto_00012] ⌈ In case several Crypto Driver instances (of same or different
vendor) are implemented in one ECU the file names, API names, and published
parameters must be distinguished such that no two definitions with the same name
are generated.
The name shall be formatted according to SWS_BSW_00102: Crypto_<vi>_<ai>,
where <vi> is the vendorId and <ai> is the vendorApiInfix.
()
[SWS_Crypto_00013] ⌈ The Crypto Driver may support all crypto primitives that are
supported by the underlying hardware object.
(SRS_CryptoStack_00098)
A job, declared in CSM specification [5], is an instance of a configured cryptographic
primitive.
[SWS_Crypto_00014] ⌈ A Crypto Driver Object shall only support processing one job
at one time.
()
[SWS_Crypto_00117] ⌈ A Crypto Driver with n Crypto Driver Objects shall be able to
process n jobs in parallel.
()
Hint: Jobs, that are in the job queue (described in chapter 7.2.3.1), do not count as in
processing.
[SWS_Crypto_00224] ⌈ If a Crypto Driver requires Random Number Generator
services for internal use (e.g. Crypto_KeyExchangeCalcPubVal), it shall configure
the first Crypto Driver Object (object number 0) for this purpose. The configuration is
done in ECUC_Crypto_00044 and ECUC_Crypto_00045.
()
It is also possible to configure and use other Crypto Driver Objects with its own
default Random Number Generator.
[SWS_Crypto_00225] ⌈ If a Crypto Driver Object has no default Random Number
Generator but requires Random Number values, it shall use Crypto Driver Object 0 to
request the Random Numbers.
