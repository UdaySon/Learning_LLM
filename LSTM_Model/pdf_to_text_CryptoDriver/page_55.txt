8.3.4 Key Management Interface
Note:
If the actual key element to be modified is directly mapped to flash memory, there
could be a bigger delay when calling the key management functions (synchronous
operation)
[SWS_Crypto_00145] ⌈ If the underlying crypto hardware does not allow execution
of key management functions at the same time as processing a job, the key
management functions shall wait while the current job is executed and start the
processing of the key management function afterwards.
()
Note:
It has to be ensured, that the jobs are processed fast enough to avoid that the key
management function has to wait for a long time.
It is also recommended to use CRYPTO_OPERATIONMODE_SINGLECALL for the
jobs.
8.3.4.1 Key Setting Interface
8.3.4.1.1 Crypto_KeyElementSet
[SWS_Crypto_00223] ⌈ The crypto driver shall only perform this operation if
CryptoKeyElement/CryptoKeyElementWriteAccess is set to
CRYPTO_WA_ALLOWED or CRYPTO_WA_ENCRYPTED.
 ()
Note: If the key element references a SHE-key, it is recommended to set
CryptoKeyElementWriteAccess to CRYPTO_WA_ENCRYPTED. The key itself
must be provided as SHE-keys in the format M1M2M3.
