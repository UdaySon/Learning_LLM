multiple items can be supported. Otherwise, further CryptoPrimitive(s) for this
CryptoPrimitiveService must be defined.

Example:
A crypto primitive service ENCRYPT may support AES and 3DES with mode ECB
and CBC in all permutations (AES-CBC, AES-ECB, 3DES-CBC and 3DES-ECB). But
a crypto primitive service ENCRYPT, with support of family items for AES and RSA
and mode CBC are not valid, because RSA-CBC is not reasonably supported. In this
case, a new CryptoPrimitive for RSA shall be defined.
7.1.2 Cryptographic capabilities
The capabilities of a Crypto Driver can be divided in the two main topics: key storage
and supported algorithms. The supported algorithms can be pre-configured by
creating a new CryptoPrimitive container (e.g. MacGenerate). In this container the
vendor can now specify that the Crypto Driver is for example only capable of doing a
CMAC. In this case, an example configuration would be:
CryptoPrimitiveAlgorithmFamily = CRYPTO_ALGOFAM_AES
CryptoPrimitiveAlgorithmMode = CRYPTO_ALGOMODE_CMAC
CryptoPrimitiveAlgorithmSecondaryFamily =
CRYPTO_ALGOMODE_NOT_SET
CryptoPrimitiveService = MacGenerate
The primitive MacGenerate can then be referenced by the Crypto Driver Object to
show, that it is capable of doing a CMAC. If no other primitives a pre-configured, the
Crypto Driver Object is not able to perform e.g. an AES encryption.
If all primitives are independent from each other, a vendor would pre-configure one
Crypto Driver Object for each primitive. Otherwise, there would be one Crypto Driver
Object, which would reference all primitives.
7.1.3 Available Keys
The keys, which are provided by the Crypto Driver can also be pre-configured. A
CryptoKey container references a specific CryptoKeyType. The CryptoKeyType
provides the information which key elements are contained in a CryptoKey
referencing this CryptoKeyType.
The vendor also pre-configures the key elements to define:
- read/write access
- the maximum size of the element
- if the element can be read/written with data smaller than the maximum size
- the init value after startup if the element is not already initialized
