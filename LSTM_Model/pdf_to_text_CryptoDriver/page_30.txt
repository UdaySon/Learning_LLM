}
The fields of type RSAPublicKey have the following meanings:
 modulus is the modulus n.
 publicExponent is the public exponent e.

[SWS_Crypto_00187]⌈ For the RSA public key in the format
CRYPTO_KE_FORMAT_BIN_IDENT_PUBLICKEY the “subjectPublicKey BIT
STRING” is defined as “RSAPublicKey”.
Explanation:
Considering RFC5280, section 4.1, the SubjectPublicKeyInfo follows directly the
definition described above. Thus, a key type of
CRYPTO_KE_FORMAT_BIN_IDENT_PUBLICKEY matches SubjectPublicKeyInfo
and CRYPTO_KE_FORMAT_BIN _RSA_PUBLICKEY matches the subjectPublicKey
in this definition.
(SRS_CryptoStack_00008)
[SWS_Crypto_00188]⌈ The algorithm identifier for RSA keys shall have the value
1.2.840.113549.1.1.1. This corresponds to the ASN.1 coded OID value “2A 86 48 86
F7 0D 01 01 01”. This OID shall be provided whenever an AlgorithmIdentifier for RSA
is required. In other words, when a key has the format
CRYPTO_KE_FORMAT_BIN_IDENT_PRIVATEKEY_ PKCS8 or
CRYPTO_KE_FORMAT_BIN_IDENT_PUBLICKEY and is used for RSA, the
AlgorithmIdentifier must have this value.
Note: In some cases, a NULL value is followed directly to the OID. So, a value that
follows directly after this OID in the same sequence is optional and should be
tolerated.

7.2.5.2 Definition of ECC Key Material
[SWS_Crypto_00189]⌈ Due to a lack of clear and efficient standard definition for
ECC keys, key material for ECC is defined as binary information in the format
definition of CRYPTO_KE_FORMAT_BIN_OCTET. The length of data depends on
the assigned curve operation.
(SRS_CryptoStack_00008)
[SWS_Crypto_00190]⌈ Public keys for NIST and Brainpool ECC curves are provided
with their X and Y coordinates:
ECC Public Key = Point X | Point Y.
The points are stored in little endian format.
