[SWS_Crypto_00123] ⌈ If development error detection for the Crypto Driver is
enabled: The function Crypto_CancelJob shall raise the error
CRYPTO_E_UNINIT and return E_NOT_OK if the module is not yet initialized.
 ( )
[SWS_Crypto_00124] ⌈ If development error detection for the Crypto Driver is
enabled: The function Crypto_CancelJob shall raise the error
CRYPTO_E_PARAM_HANDLE and return E_NOT_OK if the parameter objectId is
out or range.
 ( )
[SWS_Crypto_00125] ⌈ If development error detection for the Crypto Driver is
enabled: The function Crypto_CancelJob shall raise the error
CRYPTO_E_PARAM_POINTER and return E_NOT_OK if the parameter job is a null
pointer.

[SWS_Crypto_00214] ⌈ If no errors are detected by Crypto Driver and the driver
does currently not process this job, the service Crypto_CancelJob() shall return
E_OK without any processing.
()
[SWS_Crypto_00143] ⌈ If no errors are detected by Crypto Driver and the driver is
able to cancel the job immediately, the service Crypto_CancelJob() shall remove
the job from the queue and cancel the job in the hardware. If the cancellation is
successful E_OK shall be returned, otherwise it shall return E_NOT_OK.
()
Note:
Especially hardware implementations may not support a cancelation. If
Crypto_CancelJob() is called and immediate cancelation is not possible at least
all results and notifications of the job shall be suppressed. The caller can be sure,
that there will be no (intermediate) results by callback or synchronous result value.
[SWS_Crypto_00183] ⌈ If no errors are detected by Crypto Driver and the driver is
not able to cancel the job (e.g. due to hardware limitations), the service
Crypto_CancelJob() shall return CRYPTO_E_JOB_CANCELED.
()
Note:
SWS_Crypto_00183 should not have any effect on the job processing in the Crypto
Driver. The processing should be completed as any other regular job. The CSM
guarantees that the result buffer pointer is valid until the job is finished.
