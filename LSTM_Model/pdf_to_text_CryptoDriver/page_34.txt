[SWS_Crypto_00245] ⌈ If a key is currently updated in NV RAM Block and has not
yet been written by NVM, then this shall be reflected in the key status with
CRYPTO_KEYSTATUS_UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS through the
Crypto_KeyGetStatus() interface.
(SRS_CryptoStack_00008)
[SWS_Crypto_00246] ⌈ For each configured CryptoNvBlock the Crypto driver shall
provide a separate set of Crypto_<vi>_<ai>_NvBlock_xxx_<NvBlock>()
functions (xxx refers to Init, ReadFrom, WriteTo and Callback) (see chapter Callback
notification). The short name of the CryptoNvBlock container replaces the tag
<NvBlock>. The tags <vi> and <ai> are replaced as described in
[SWS_Crypto_00012]. These functions shall be set as callbacks in the respective
fields of the NvmBlockDescriptor.

7.2.6.2 Reading Keys from NVM
[SWS_Crypto_00247] ⌈ On initialization of the crypto driver, the callback function
Crypto_<vi>_<ai>_NvBlock_ReadFrom_<NvBlock>() shall be called to
retrieve the previously persisted key elements for the associated Keys.
(SRS_CryptoStack_00008)
Note:
The format of the data within the NvBlock are local to the driver. At least, the driver
needs to make sure that key elements and keys can be uniquely assigned within the
NV RAM Block. Also, versioning of NV RAM Block data for future updates of the
format shall be considered. Data consistency of the block may be considered.
[SWS_Crypto_00248] ⌈ On initialization, if an NvBlock could be read successfully
and the internal consistency check of the NvBlock data was successful, all key
elements of the referencing keys to this block shall be set with the value from the NV
RAM Block data.
(SRS_CryptoStack_00061, SRS_CryptoStack_00117)
[SWS_Crypto_00249] ⌈
On initialization, when reading an NvBlock for keys and the block is available but
corrupted (driver internal data consistency check failed), all related keys shall be set
to invalid. The length value of all associated key elements, where
CryptoKeyElementPersist is set to TRUE, shall be set to 0 even if
CryptoKeyElementInitValue is set for this key.
