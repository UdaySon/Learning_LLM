Depending of the crypto service configured in job->jobPrimitiveInfo->
primitiveInfo->service, different parameters of job->jobPrimitiveInput
are required to be set with valid values. The table in SWS_Crypto_00071 specifies
which parameters are required or optional for a service in different modes. The
following requirements specify the behavior if a required member is a null pointer.
