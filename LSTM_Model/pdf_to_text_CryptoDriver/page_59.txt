[SWS_Crypto_00222] ⌈ The crypto driver shall only perform this operation if
CryptoKeyElement/CryptoKeyElementReadAccess is set to
CRYPTO_RA_ALLOWED or CRYPTO_RA_ENCRYPTED.
 ()
Note: Reading keys from SHE hardware is not possible, except if it is a SHE RAM-
Key. In this case, reading the SHE key will provide M1M2M3. The key element
should be set to CRYPTO_RA_ENCRYPTED in this case.

Holds the identifier of the key whose key element shall be returned.
KeyId
Parameters
(in) key
Element Holds the identifier of the key element which shall be returned.
Id
Holds a pointer to a memory location in which the length information is
stored. On calling this function this parameter shall contain the size of the
result buffer provided by resultPtr. If the key element is configured to allow
Parameters
Length partial access, this parameter contains the amount of data which should

Ptr be read from the key element. The size may not be equal to the size of
the provided buffer anymore. When the request has finished, the amount
of data that has been stored shall be stored.
