It is unlikely to compose such formats back to the application by the crypto driver.
Thus, such a key element might only be temporarily stored and may not persisted in
"composed" format (M1M2M3), e.g. to retrieve that after reset.
[SWS_Crypto_00184]⌈ Asymmetric key material with identification is specified in
accordance to RFC5958 in ASN.1 format. The key material with the format specifier
CRYPTO_KE_FORMAT_BIN_IDENT_PRIVATEKEY_ PKCS8 needs to follow this
format specification:
OneAsymmetricKey ::= SEQUENCE {
version Version,
KeyAlgorithm KeyAlgorithmIdentifier,
keyMaterial KeyMaterial,
attributes* [0] Attributes OPTIONAL,
...,
[[2: publicKey* [1] PublicKey OPTIONAL ]],
...
}
* The optional values for key attributes and the PublicKey are currently not used
within the crypto driver and is listed here just for compatibility reason to RFC5958. A
driver shall tolerate the provision of this information but doesn’t need to evaluate its
contents.
The elements have the following meaning:
Version ::= INTEGER { v1(0), v2(1) } (v1, ..., v2)
KeyAlgorithmIdentifier ::= AlgorithmIdentifier
{ PUBLIC-KEY,
{ PrivateKeyAlgorithms } }
KeyMaterial ::= OCTET STRING
-- Content varies based on the type of the key and is specified by its
AlgorithmIdentifier.
-- The KeyAlgorithmIdentifier defines which format specifier for KeyMaterial
shall be applied.
AlgorithmIdentifier: A value that identifies the format by its object identifier (OID).
