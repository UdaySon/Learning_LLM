7 Functional specification
The Crypto Driver module is located in the micro controller abstraction layer and is
below the Crypto Interface module and Crypto Service Manager module. It
implements a generic interface for synchronous and asynchronous cryptographic
primitives. It also supports key storage, key configuration, and key management for
cryptographic services.
To provide cryptographic functionalities an ECU needs to integrate one unique
Crypto Service Manager module and one Crypto Interface. However, the Crypto
Interface can access several Crypto Drivers, each of them is configured according to
the underlying Crypto Driver Object.
A Crypto Driver Object represents an instance of independent crypto hardware
“device” (e.g. AES accelerator). There could be a channel for fast AES and CMAC
calculations on an HSM for jobs with high priority, which ends on a native AES
calculation service in the Crypto Driver. But it is also possible, that a Crypto Driver
Object is a piece of software, e.g. for RSA calculations where jobs are able to
encrypt, decrypt, sign or verify data. The Crypto Driver Object is the endpoint of a
crypto channel.
7.1 Pre-Configuration
The vendor of the Crypto Driver has to provide a pre-configuration for the Crypto
Driver which represents the capabilities of the Crypto Driver. The pre-configuration
shall be delivered with the BSWMD-file of the Crypto Driver.
