7.1.1 CryptoPrimitive configuration
The Crypto Driver contains one or more crypto driver objects that each supports one
or more crypto primitive service. Algorithm family and mode provides details on how
to operate crypto primitive services. For example, the crypto primitive service
“Encrypt” supports the Family “AES” and the mode “CBC”. Further refinements are
required by setting secondary family values.
The CryptoPrimitive configuration of a crypto driver object defines the possible
options for a crypto primitive service. From the example above, the driver can
support the modes CBC or ECB for an AES algorithm. This is sometimes referred as
the “capabilities” of the driver for a specific crypto primitive service. Thus, a
CryptoPrimitive may configure several family and mode values if it is applicable for a
crypto service primitive.
The job configuration of the CSM contains a reference to a CsmPrimitive. The
corresponding Config section of this CsmPrimitive also defines the families and
mode, but with multiplicity of 1, to identify uniquely what combination of family and
mode shall be used for a job. At least, the associated crypto driver object must
contain a CryptoPrimitive that supports the configuration. This shall be ensured on
configuration level and at least checked at runtime.
To support new features for a crypto service which aren’t yet modelled in the
specification (in the various enumerations of family and mode), custom specific
algorithm families and modes can be configured in the crypto driver. The
CryptoPrimitive references to these custom values to indicate what combination of
crypto primitive service, (custom-)family and (custom-)mode are possible.
The CSM job configuration need to reference to these custom configuration items.
