length of job->outputPtr provided with job->outputLengthPtr shall be
checked if all context relevant data can be stored. If not, the function shall return
E_NOT_OK.
()
[SWS_Crypto_00230] ⌈ To save the context the crypto driver object shall store all
relevant workspace data of the currently active primitive that was modified by
previously processed START and UPDATE operation and shall place them into
job->outputPtr (so-called snapshot of context data). The length of the provided
data shall be written to the memory where job->outputLengthPtr references to.
The function shall return E_OK if the operation was successful.
()
Note:
The context data shall contain all data that is needed to restore a workspace with this
data, so that the crypto primitive can resume the operation at exactly this point. For
example, if a MAC calculation is currently processed, all internal data of the
workspace shall be provided so that subsequent update and finish operation provides
the same MAC as if the job is newly setup, e.g. with a START operation, the context
is restored and the same set of data is provided when the context snapshot was
saved. This shall result in the same MAC.
[SWS_Crypto_00231] ⌈ If job->jobPrimitiveInputOutput->mode is set to
CRYPTO_OPERATIONMODE_RESTORE_CONTEXT when the crypto driver is called, then
first job->inputLength shall be checked if the length of the provided context data is
large enough for the currently active primitive. If not, the function shall return
E_NOT_OK and shall leave the current state untouched. If enough data are
provided, the data from job->inputPtr shall be extracted and copied to the right place
in the current workspace. If the workspace has been successfully restored the
function shall return E_ OK.
()
Note:
The provision of context data to software components can have high security
impacts. A thorough security analysis should be made before this feature is activated
and used. At least, it bears the risk of leaking key material to a malicious caller of this
function.
It is up to the crypto driver (object) to perform a consistency check or to encrypt,
respectively decrypt the context data. But for security reason it is highly
recommended to use encryption.
