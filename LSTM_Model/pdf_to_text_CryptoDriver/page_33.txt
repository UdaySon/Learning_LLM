or to Crypto_ProcessJob() with primitive service CRYPTO_KEYSETVALID or
CRYPTO_KEYSETINVALID set. Thus, key element storage in NVM shall not be
initiated on a call to Crypto_KeyElementSet() or similar operation. The storage
operation shall only take place if the validation was successfully finished and the
operation returns E_OK (either directly by a synchronous call or asynchronously
through the callback).
(SRS_CryptoStack_00061)
Rationale:
Especially when key elements of a key have interdependencies to one or more other
key element(s) of the same key, writing the key element immediately when it is set
has the risk, that the key itself can be inconsistent. In addition, the explicit initiation of
the operation with KEYSETVALID allows the crypto driver to check the consistency
and interdependency of all elements and storing will be denied if the check fails.
Also, updating several elements of a key will result in a single write operation to NVM
and not multiple times for each key element, which can reduce the total number of
write operations to NVM.
[SWS_Crypto_00243] ⌈ On KEYSETVALID operation, writing the data block to NVM
will be initiated by a call of the crypto driver to NvM_SetRamBlockStatus(). This is
the typical operation when the configuration
CryptoNvBlock/CryptoNvBlockProcessing is set to DEFERRED.
If CryptoNvBlock/CryptoNvBlockProcessing is set to IMMEDIATE, the Crypto
Driver will, besides the call to NvM_SetRamBlockStatus(), also call
NvM_WriteBlock() immediately afterwards. This will trigger an immediate write of
the NV RAM Block to non-volatile memory.
(SRS_CryptoStack_00008, SRS_CryptoStack_00118, SRS_CryptoStack_00120)
Note:
For proper operation it is recommended to set the parameter
NvMBlockUseSetRamBlockStatus and NvMSelectBlockForReadAll of the
NVM to TRUE. The value NvMSelectBlockForWriteAll shall be set to TRUE if
CryptoNvBlockProcessing is set to DEFERRED.
[SWS_Crypto_00244] ⌈ If a call to an NVM service (NvM_SetRamBlockStatus()
or NvM_WriteBlock()) returns with E_NOT_OK, or when the callback function
Crypto_<vi>_<ai>_NvBlock_Callback_<NvBlock> (see
[SWS_Crypto_91026]) indicates with Nvm_RequestResultType that the block
write operation has failed, the runtime error CRYPTO_E_RE_NVM_ACCESS_FAILED
shall be reported to the DET. In addition, the service call shall be requested again on
the next execution of Crypto_MainFunction(). The number of retries can be
limited by the parameter CryptoNvBlock/CryptoNvBlockFailedRetries.
