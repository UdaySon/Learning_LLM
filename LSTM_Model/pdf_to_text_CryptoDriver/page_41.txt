[SWS_Crypto_00217]⌈ The crypto Driver shall check if job->cryptoKeyId and, if
applicable, job->targetCryptoKeyId are in range, before it executes a job. If the
check fails, the function Crypto_ProcessJob() shall report
CRYPTO_E_PARAM_HANDLE to DET and return E_NOT_OK.
()
[SWS_Crypto_00195]⌈ If a Crypto Driver API is called and any buffer addressed
during the operation is too small, then the operation shall not be performed. If
development error detection for the Crypto Driver is enabled, then the API function
shall report CRYPTO_E_SMALL_BUFFER to the DET, else return E_NOT_OK.
