Resetting a job using “START” is only possible when the job is not actively being
processed.
[SWS_Crypto_00118] ⌈ If Crypto_ProcessJob() is called while the job is in state
“Idle” and the “START” flag in the operation mode is not set, the function shall return
with E_NOT_OK.
()
Note:
If Crypto_ProcessJob() is called while in “Active” state and with the operation
mode “UPDATE”, the crypto primitive is fed with input data. In terms of streaming of
arbitrary amounts of user data multiple calls with operation mode “UPDATE” is used,
to feed more input data to the previously ones. In the “Update” state, there are
usually also calculations of intermediate results of cryptographic primitives. Actually,
in some cases (e.g. AES Encryption in CBC mode) there is also the generation of
output data. While operating with the streaming approach (“Start”, “Update”, “Finish”)
the Crypto Driver Object is waiting for further input (“Update”) until the “Finish” state
has been reached. No other job could be processed meanwhile.
[SWS_Crypto_00023] ⌈ If Crypto_ProcessJob() is called while in “Active” state
and with the operation mode “FINISH”, the cryptographic calculations shall be
finalized. Additional data (i.e. the MAC to be tested on a MAC verification service)
shall be available at this point to process this job successfully. The results of the
calculations shall be stored in the output buffers. At end of the processing the Crypto
Driver shall switch to “Idle” state.
()
To process a crypto service with a single call with Crypto_ProcessJob() the
operation mode ”CRYPTO_OPERATIONMODE_SINGLECALL” is a disjunction (bitwise
OR) of the 3 modes “START”, ”UPDATE” and ”FINISH”.
[SWS_Crypto_00025] ⌈ If an internal error occurs, the corresponding job state shall
be set to "Idle" and all input data and intermediate results shall be discarded.
()
[SWS_Crypto_00119] ⌈ If an internal error occurs while processing an asynchronous
job, the corresponding job state shall be set to "Idle" and all input data and
intermediate results shall be discarded. Further, the callback notification shall be
called with an appropriate error code.

Note: The information whether the job shall be processed synchronously or
asynchronously is part of the Crypto_JobType.
