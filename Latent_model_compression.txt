1. Use MOE as a base model --> even in one expert group , decide in between if that chainof operation to be continiued or not, becasue at the end only one token which need to comeout as a probability.
2. Requirement tracing tool --> Internal requirement --> verification criteria --> SWAD -->
	a. In SWAD diagram  --> while drawing interfaces use real c code interfaces and later the code shall validate the SWAD interface for correctness.
	b. Generate the tests for the interface, that pass some values to interface and see if those are reaching the calling module  -- kind of unit test focusing on interface than on complete functionality.
	c. From SWAD design the SWDDD within each module and these variables and function names shall match in the code.
        d. In fact generate the code from SWDD using the same global and function names, generate the template code - andn improvise to generate the function code after the SWDD along with the tests.
	e. SWDD provides good inputs to code generation  model - generated code to go through the regressive test.
	f. Refactor the CDH and generate the CDH according to the autosar.
 A full compact tool to ease the software developement for C base softwares

3. Make build system readiness - create a readymade template for make build systems, kind of GUI to configure the build system and then generate the required make files.
4. Make file unwinding
5. SWDD to code generation   --> from legacy take all the functions, and 2 options 1. to use exiting or create new one
